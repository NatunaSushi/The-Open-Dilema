# Opinions on the netflix documentary "the social dilema"
### by Nathan Suciu




## The Introduction
```markdown
*the social dilema* is a documentary that attempts to document the overarching issue that plauges the technology industry.
Over the course of its time, it tries to explain in what ways technology has a grasp on people today, 
and how the intentions behind the current technology controling the world is not inherently moral. It does a brilliant job at conveying the feelings a teenager
would muster in social media. It almost feels as if every electronic movement you make is being constantly tracked and monitored
to a scary degree.
