# Opinions on the netflix documentary "the social dilema"
### by Nathan Suciu




## The Introduction
```markdown
*the social dilema* is a documentary that attempts to document the overarching issue that plauges the technology industry.
Over the course of its time, it tries to explain in what ways technology has a grasp on people today, 
and how the intentions behind the current technology controling the world is not inherently moral. It does a brilliant job at conveying the feelings a teenager
would muster in social media. It almost feels as if every electronic movement you make is being constantly tracked and monitored
to a scary degree.

## The Problem
```markdown
The problem trying to be conveyed in this documentary is one thats hard to explain.
This is mainly because its grown so massive that it is hard to identify as one problem.
The problem is that the technology industry at a start was created for the purpose of benefiting itself, not its users.
Computers have taken up such a core part of society, and yet their core purpose wasn't to serve to the people, but to get as many people served as possible.

## The Opinions

I found this documentary to be an interesting watch, as it attempts to describe a world I've been stuck in my whole life. I feel happy that a work that describes how 
much the world is overtaken simply exists. I want people to learn and be warned from social media as its a terrifying thing.
My main personal issue with this documentary is that it suggests to stay away from the waves, rather than saying how to ride them.
The Social Dilema attempts to paint a picture of a world so encased in the social medias that companies have full control over us. 
I disagree that these are the only solutions, and I recognize a failure to document the masses about the side of technology that isn't so, eco-maniacal.


FLOSS is the acronym used to refer to a Software that is Free. Libre. and Open Source. It acts as a small part of the whole social dilema but it could very well be the 
first step to a solution. One of the main problems within the social dilema is how most social medias are designed for the soul purpose of making money. Every decision 
ever made at Meta or Google will be about money. The only time any company would think about benefitting the user is when its viable monetarily. FLOSS software is a 
major example of software that doesnt have this problem. It exists for the people and is manajaged by the people. For years now I'ved lived attempting to prove how one 
can still be connected, but never have to be a part of the tracking. People should be educated on how to use open source alternatives for apps, people should be 
educated on how to degoogle or privatize a phone. Companies should not be trusted to fix the problems they created, we should instead evolve to manuver around them.
There are alternatives for nearly all commonly used applications that do not track their users. If people were told how to properly identify and locate these 
alternatives, then maybe the social dilema could be mitigated.

*The Social Dilema* attempts to educate the world on how its falling around them, but perfectly circles around possible solutions. The documentart acts as a call to 
action with no ideas as to how. I find it frustrating to watch as the call to action that could have gotten people talking doesn't acknowledge how people within the 
tech industry avoid being tracked.
there has also been a surgance of "privacy oriented" services that do the same tracking while advertising to not. VPNs are a common way of blocking your ISP from 
seeing what you are doing online, but it does nothing to prevent tracking. Still many VPN companies have recently sprouted up out of nowhere claiming to procect user 
data. This is concerning considering that the true purpose of a VPN is to re-route somebodys computer traffic (for encryption, but the vpn service provider has the 
key).

A real tip on how to be tracked less is to like, turn off your location.

In actuality a private phone can be created by removing google services and internet proxies from a standard android phone. Usually also adding a custom OS to make 
sure there are no trackers. One can still browse social media with such a device, but is tracked significantly less. This also leads to the possibility of data 
poisoning with a location spoofing application.


## Conclusion

My opinions on *The Social Dilema* are convoluted and chaotic, as it covers a subject so incredibly vast with such a large amount of moving parts. I feel happy that people are more aware of how companies track them. I feel sad that most people don't know about ways to escape the matrix. *The Social Dilema* should have taken the time to not only show the chaos but also show how to control it. Considering I use arch linux most of the time it makes sense I have these opinions.
